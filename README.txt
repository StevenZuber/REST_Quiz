EST Quiz

Weekend Project of week 12 of Skill Distillery

Overview:

This is a simple quiz app that allows users to take and delete quizzes. The create quiz button only allows users to add a new quiz name to the list, not an entire quiz with questions and answers. The view button is currently not functional. Each quiz gets added to user 1, since we haven’t yet worked on secure logins for users. 

Technologies: 

The quiz is built on top of a mysql database, built in mysql workbench. The database is used in Java JPA and MVC, where object entities are mapped to mysql table elements. The user interface was built entirely in JavaScript, with about 40 lines of css for styling. 


Future Goals:

I’d like to have the view button display the quiz questions, but without showing the answers. I’d also like to implement full quiz creation for users to be able to add. 

Stumbling Blocks: 

Working with variable scope in JavaScript poses new challenges when compared to Java. The workarounds aren’t yet intuitive. I also ran into a few problems when persisting user scores after they take a quiz.
